          <h3>Meet Our Founder</h3>
          <img id="family" src="assets/family.jpg" alt="Pat's family photo" title="Pat with his wife Flo and his children Simon and Cookie">
          <p>When Pat's wife Flo was expecting their twins, she craved salmon and cookies all the time. Pat, who fancied himself a hero to his pregnant wife, created Salmon Cookies to satisfy her cravings.</p>
          <p>Flo feasted on Salmon Cookies throughout her pregnancy, so Pat and Flo agreed that their children should be named Simon and Cookie to honor Pat's hard work during Flo's pregnancy. Although Flo's cravings subsided after giving birth, Pat decided he had an obligation to share his pregnancy cookies with the the scores of unsuspecting tourists who visit Seattle each year, and so began Pat's Salmon Cookies.</p>
          <img id="chinook" src="assets/chinook.jpg" alt="photo of Chinook salmon" title="Chinook salmon are not 'ambi-turners'; that is, they can only swim toward the left edge of the screen.">
          <p>Pat and Flo have since become vocal advocates for limiting commercial fishing of the Chinook salmon, which is the staple food for the 3 orca pods that live in Puget Sound, attracting tourists in hordes into Pat's highly profitable stores.</p>
          <img id="fishfamily" src="assets/fish.jpg" alt="Pat's fish-family photo" title="Pat has always encouraged his family to have fish alter-egos. He drew this to share his dream with others, including his therapist.">
          <p>Each year on the twins' birthday, each of the family makes an art piece that honors the family's connection to salmon. The piece shown here was Pat's masterpiece this year, and it hangs proudly on the family's refrigerator to remind them of who they are.</p>
